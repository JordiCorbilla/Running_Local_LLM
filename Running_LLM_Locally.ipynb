      "The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used to estimate the value of a European-style option, that is, an option that can only be exercised at its expiration date. The model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion and that the volatility of the asset is constant over time.\n",
      "The code defines two functions, `black_scholes`, which calculates the prices of a call option and a put option, and `norm.cdf`, which calculates the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution.\n",
      "The function `black_scholes` takes five arguments:\n",
      "* `S`: the current price of the underlying asset\n",
      "* `K`: the strike price of the option\n",
      "* `t`: the time to expiration of the option\n",
      "* `r`: the risk-free interest rate\n",
      "* `sigma`: the volatility of the underlying asset\n",
      "The function first calculates two variables, `d1` and `d2`, which are used in the Black-Scholes formula. These variables are defined as the discount factor and the spot price of the option, respectively.\n",
      "The function then uses these variables to calculate the prices of the call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula. The prices are returned as a tuple containing the call price and the put price.\n",
      "Note that this is just one implementation of the Black-Scholes model in Python, and there may be other ways to implement it depending on your specific needs and requirements.\n"
